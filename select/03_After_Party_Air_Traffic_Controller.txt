I was walking up the driveway
sliding through the door
everybody's looking my way
don't know what for
like I'm not supposed to be
here don't know the code
you can't choose where you come from
only where you go
lights are all on and the music is loud
everyone raise a fist everyone shout
police are here and they're kicking us out
they're kicking us out
how'd we end up at the after party
did I show up at the wrong address
are we a part of the drunk majority
or just another uninvited guest
in the morning it's a different story
when everybody's cleaning up the mess
I don't believe in the after party
I don't believe in it, can't believe it
some started a bonfire
some went to the show
some headed for border
to be left alone
looking out at the chaos
with a crooked grin
gotta pay off the pit boss
in the state we're in
party is over we're stuck on the couch
I'd say it's bullshit but I'm not allowed
authority's here and they're kicking us out
they're kicking us out
how'd we end up at the after party
did I show up at the wrong address
are we a part of the drunk majority
or just another uninvited guest
in the morning it's a different story
when everybody's cleaning up the mess
I don't believe in the after party
I don't believe in it
what the hell just happened
did we burn it down
can we still throw a party
when there ain't no house
lights are all on and the music is loud
everyone raise a fist everyone shout
police are here and they're kicking us out
they're kicking us out
how'd we end up at the after party
did I show up at the wrong address
are we a part of the drunk majority
or just another uninvited guest
in the morning it's a different story
when everybody's cleaning up the mess
I don't believe in the after party
I don't believe in it, can't believe it
can't believe it
