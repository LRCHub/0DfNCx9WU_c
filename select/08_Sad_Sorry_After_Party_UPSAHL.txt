"Hey, it's nice to meet ya"
Is what he said to me
Baby, let me treat ya
To a shot or three
I think you're hot, but I was
Just about to leave
Join me if you wanna
I live right down the street
I was gonna go home
Pop a bottle in the bathtub while I get stoned
From the bar into the back
Of a cab, up the stairs
To my bedroom
It's a sad sorry afterparty
Tears be tasting like Bacardi
Don't scream, you'll wake up Molly
She's got work tomorrow morning
Sad sorry afterparty
Just my feelings getting sloppy
Don't scream, you'll wake up Molly
Sad sorry afterparty
Here's the part where we yell
Off the balcony
Make out in the shower
'Til we can barely breathe
He said, "Let's go to Malibu"
But I just wanna cry into the swimming pool
"Hey, it's nice to meet ya"
Is what he said to me
I was gonna go home
Pop a bottle in the bathtub while I get stoned
From the bar into the back
Of a cab, up the stairs
To my bedroom
It's a sad sorry afterparty
Tears be tasting like Bacardi
Don't scream, you'll wake up Molly
She's got work tomorrow morning
Sad sorry afterparty
Just my feelings getting sloppy
Don't scream, you'll wake up Molly
Sad sorry afterparty
Sad sorry afterparty
Tears be tasting like Bacardi
Don't scream, you'll wake up Molly
She's got work tomorrow morning
Sad sorry afterparty
Sun came up and I'm still sloppy
Put some whiskey in my coffee
Sad sorry afterparty
Sad sorry afterparty
Sad sorry afterparty
